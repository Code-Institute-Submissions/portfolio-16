# Fernanda's Resume

This website presents the main information about me. It's structured in 4 parts: Me, Experience, What I like doing and What I studied.
The Me section is a short introduction of who I am and also has my contact information. The Experience part shows my most recent work experience and also my main skills.
What I like doing is the part where I mention subjects I like and personal projects I developed mixing them. Finally, What I studied section brings information about the universities I studied, as well as courses I followed after I graduated. 

The website also has a link to a CV download, in pdf format - available only for desktop view. 
Other than that, there is a link to the Things I created: so far this reference points to my behance portfolio, but for the future this will be reserved to a new section from the website, which is going to show my coding projects.
